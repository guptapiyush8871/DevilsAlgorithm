Consider that there is a associative number with the alphabet as below :
A - 1
B - 2
C - 3
...
...
J - 10
...
...
X - 24
Y - 25
Z - 26

Here, 26 can also be treated as BF (26 - BF) apart from Z. Zero should be treated as empty so 10 can be treated as J as well as A(10 - A).
Given a numeric string. There can be many decryption possible for this string. You should output the total number of possible decryption. 

INPUT :
S : numeric string
0 < length(S) < 10^5

OUTPUT :
Number of possible decryption

NOTE : Alphabets are not case sensitive.

EXAMPLE :
1. 
INPUT :
1221

OUTPUT :
5

EXPLANATION :
Possible decryption : {ABU, LU, ALA, ABBA, LBA}
For the ABU : 1 2 21 = A B U (21 becomes U)

1. 
INPUT :
1001

OUTPUT :
3

EXPLANATION :
Possible decryption : {AA, JA, K}
For the ABU : 1001 = AA (0 is treated as empty)
			  10 0 1 = JA (0 is treated as empty)
			  1001 = K (0 is treated as empty, 11 becomes K)
