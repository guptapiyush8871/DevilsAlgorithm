Given an input stream of n characters consisting only of small case alphabets the task is to find the first non repeating character each time a character is inserted to the stream.

Example

Flow in stream : a, a, b, c
a goes to stream : 1st non repeating element a (a)
a goes to stream : no non repeating element -1 (5, 15)
b goes to stream : 1st non repeating element is b (a, a, b)
c goes to stream : 1st non repeating element is b (a, a, b, c)

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the stream. Then in the next line are x characters which are inserted to the stream.

Output:
For each test case in a new line print the first non repeating elements separated by spaces present in the stream at every instinct when a character is added to the stream, if no such element is present print -1.

Constraints:
1<=T<=200
1<=N<=500

Example:
Input:
2
4
a a b c
3
a a c 
Output:
a -1 b b
a -1 c
